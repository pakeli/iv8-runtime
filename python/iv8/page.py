"""Public ``Page`` — the M2 container that owns one execution context plus the
native host objects and browser-like globals installed into it.

A page provides ``eval`` (delegated to its owned context), disposal, ``disposed``,
and context-manager use. Inside its JS context it installs: the global roots
``window`` / ``globalThis`` / ``self`` (all the same object); a minimal
``console`` (``log`` / ``info`` / ``warn`` / ``error`` → Python ``logging``);
static read-only ``navigator`` and ``location``; and JS-visible timers
(``setTimeout`` / ``clearTimeout`` / ``setInterval`` / ``clearInterval``) that run
only via the manual pumps ``run_timers()`` / ``run_jobs()``. ``load()`` refreshes
this page state from static HTML + base URL (``location`` then reflects the base
URL). It is still NOT a full page object — no public document/DOM, navigation,
history, or network. (The M2-1 framework probe ``hostProbe`` is also installed as
internal infrastructure, not a stable API.)

The public API shape is identical in both build modes: when V8 is linked,
``Page()`` creates a context and installs the above; in a V8-free skeleton build
``Page()`` raises ``RuntimeError`` (mirroring ``JSContext``).

        internal document-bootstrap state. This is NOT a real navigation/loader —
        no network, subresources, or history.

        M3-5 HTML script integration: the document's own scripts are executed
        first, in **HTML document order** (inline ``<script>...</script>`` and
        ``<script src="...">`` interleaved). An inline script runs its source
        directly; a ``<script src>`` is resolved against ``base_url`` and its

        network). ``resources`` is ``None``/omitted or a mapping of absolute-URL

        loudly (never silently skipped) via ``JSError`` (``resource_name`` = the
        resolved URL) — no rollback. M3-11: an inline ``<script>`` that fails
        reports a deterministic ``JSError.resource_name`` of
        ``"{base_url}#inline-script-{n}"``, where ``n`` is the inline script's
        1-based document-order position among inline ``<script>`` nodes (external
        ``<script src>`` and host ``scripts`` are not counted; a non-executable
        inline script still occupies its number). M3-7: while each HTML script runs,
        ``document.currentScript`` points at that ``<script>`` element (cleared to
        ``null`` after, even on error); the host ``scripts`` below never set it.
        M3-10: only minimal *classic* scripts execute — a ``<script>`` with no
        ``type``, an empty/whitespace ``type``, or ``type`` (trimmed, ASCII
        case-insensitive) ``text/javascript`` / ``application/javascript``. Any
        other type (``module`` / ``importmap`` / ``application/json`` /
        ``text/plain`` / …) stays in the DOM and ``document.scripts`` but is NOT
        run: it is not resolved against ``resources`` (so a missing resource is not
        an error) and never sets ``document.currentScript``.

        M3-1 external scripts (optional): ``scripts`` is a ``list`` of mappings,
        each with string ``name`` and ``code``. They run **after** the HTML
        document scripts, **synchronously, in list order**, in the same context
        (so they see globals from the HTML scripts and vice-versa). Each script's
        ``name`` is its resource/origin name, so a failure surfaces as ``JSError``
        with ``resource_name == name``. There is no rollback: if any script fails
        the exception propagates and the page keeps whatever earlier scripts
        already did. Timers/jobs scheduled by scripts do NOT run in the background
        — only ``run_timers()`` / ``run_jobs()`` execute them. ``scripts=None`` /
        ``[]`` and ``resources=None`` / ``{}`` degrade to the plain load path.

        Lifecycle (M3-4 + M3-6): the whole load runs with JS
        ``document.readyState === "loading"`` — every script (HTML + ``scripts``)
        observes ``"loading"``. On success, after all scripts run, a fixed
        sequence fires on ``document`` then ``window``: readyState →
        ``"interactive"``, ``readystatechange`` (document), ``DOMContentLoaded``
        (document), readyState → ``"complete"``, ``readystatechange`` (document),
        ``load`` (window). A load that failed (a script raised, or a missing
        resource) dispatches none of these and leaves ``document.readyState`` at
        ``"loading"``. Each successful (repeated) load re-walks the sequence in its
        fresh generation. (A fresh ``Page()`` never entered ``"loading"`` — its
        default generation reads ``"complete"``.) ``Page.ready_state`` keeps its
        separate M3-2 semantics.

        Repeated calls replace the prior page state; a retained ``JSValue`` from a
        previous load follows the usual disposed/invalidation rules. Raises
        ``JSContextBusyError`` if an operation is active, and
